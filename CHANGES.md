# Changes Made to Fix Soul-Bot Issues

## Syntax Error in solana-paper-trader.js

- Fixed the syntax error by moving the `discoverSolanaTokens()` method outside of the constructor but inside the class
- This was causing the "Unexpected identifier 'discoverSolanaTokens'" error that was preventing the bot from starting

## API Connection Issues

- Enhanced the DEX/connector.js file to handle Jupiter API connection issues:
  - Added retry mechanism with configurable attempts (default: 3)
  - Added request timeout with AbortController
  - Added price caching with TTL to reduce API calls
  - Implemented CoinGecko as a fallback price source
  - Added static fallback prices as a last resort

- Updated .env file to add:
  - `BACKUP_RPC_ENDPOINT`: Alternative Solana RPC endpoint
  - `HELIUS_RPC_ENDPOINT`: Helius-specific endpoint for better reliability
  - `USE_JUPITER_API_FALLBACK`: Flag to enable fallback mechanisms
  - `JUPITER_API_TIMEOUT_MS`: Timeout for Jupiter API calls
  - `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`: Number of retry attempts for API calls

## Paper Trading Balance Issues

- Updated solana-paper-trader.js to accept initialBalance from options or environment:
  - Added support for `INITIAL_PAPER_BALANCE` environment variable
  - Default balance increased to 1000 USDC (from 100 USDC)

- Updated main.js to properly initialize the paper trader with the configured balance:
  - Added `initialPaperBalance` to the engine initialization parameters
  - Ensures paper trader has sufficient balance for trades

## Deployment Automation

- Created deploy.sh script to automate deployment to Digital Ocean:
  - Copies necessary files to the droplet
  - Sets up systemd services for auto-restart
  - Configures both main bot and dashboard services

- Added detailed deployment guides:
  - README.md with general information
  - DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with step-by-step instructions

## Other Improvements

- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms throughout the codebase
- Added more detailed logging to help with troubleshooting
- Updated configuration to be more flexible with environment variables
- Improved API fallback strategies to handle network issues gracefully

## Testing

The bot now runs without crashing and properly handles:
- Jupiter API connection failures
- Paper trading with sufficient balance
- Automatic fallback to alternative price sources when needed
